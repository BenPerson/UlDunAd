[race]
description = In touch with nature and its spirits, the Elves are a more mystical and mysterious race.  They have an uncanny ability to read peoples minds and see things that most mortals can't see.  Blessed long ago by the land which they've taken care of for many centuries, they are able to use magic at levels impossible to other humanoid races.  Their tracking abilities are used solely for following others, not animals, for they do not believe it right to harm creatures at lower levels than them.  An elf's long legs are amazingly helpful when it comes to running and it is said one is able to run over 20 miles before breaking a sweat.
