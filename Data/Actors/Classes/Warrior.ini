[defclass]
description = Beings as tough as the mountains which they live in, Dwarves are a sturdy, tanking race.  Able to take much damage and not even be phased by the hardest of blows, they are amazing fighters.  The Dwarf race is quite small in height but is rather bulky, even the women, which makes them quite strong and balance yet slow because of their shortened legs and inability to manuever around tall objects.  However, Dwarves take no real practice in studying the art of magic and are instead quite religious making them not the greatest of choices for a magic lover.
